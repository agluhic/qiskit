# CODEOWNERS for Qiskit

# This file defines the set of people responsible for different sections of the
# Qiskit codebase.
#
# Code owners are empowered to approve and merge pull requests for their sections,
# and are expected to review and maintain those parts of the repository.
#
# The @Qiskit/terra-core team has global authority over qiskit-terra and can approve
# and merge code anywhere in the repo. Individual code owners are listed for
# specialized areas to ensure expertise and prompt reviews.
#
# Any contributor is welcome (and encouraged!) to review open PRs. Code ownership
# is about final approval and maintainership, not gatekeeping community input.

# Global rule: unless overridden below, @Qiskit/terra-core are the code owners.
*                       @Qiskit/terra-core
